Pechkin allows you to send private, persistent mail to players throught the chat - it will be stored on the server until the recepient acknowledges it.

Pechkin works with vanilla clients.
If Pingspam is present on the server, it will play a ping for the player.

## Usage 
`/mail send <Username> Message text` sends a message to `Username`  
`/mail` lists all messages in your inbox.
`/mail clear` clears all messages.  

You can also use the buttons that appear next to the messages in chat: the red cross deletes the message, the green R lets you reply to the sender.  

## Ignore
You can ignore mail from particularly annoying players using `/mail ignore add <offender>`
You can use `/mail ignore list` to review your ignore list and `/mail ignore remove <offender>` to stop ignoring them.
